### Welcome to the InfluxDB Enterprise configuration file.

# The values in this file override the default values used by the system if
# a config option is not specified.  The commented out lines are the configuration
# field and the default value used.  Uncommenting a line and changing the value
# will change the value used at runtime when the process is restarted.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB Enterprise will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
